"""Raw responses: the status, headers, and body of a call, without decoding the declared value.

A buffered response holds its body, with HTTPX2 having removed its content codings, and stays readable after its client
closes. A streaming response is a handle whose body is read once, into memory by `read()` or by one iteration, decoded
